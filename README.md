# Measuring NBA Success

The data is from ESPN.com. Success is measured in two ways: the team's success can be indicated by the team making into playoffs in that season, while the business sucess can also be measured by attendance per game. 

We looked at factors that are strongly associated with a team making into the playoffs or not, and factors strongassociated with attendance per game. 

The resulting paper and rmarkdown file are included.
